# Utilitopics Responsive Email

I used to work in the Marketing department at Utility Trailer Manufacturing Company. Before my time there, the company would print a small magazine called "Utilitopics" and would distribute it company-wide on a quarterly basis. The magazine would detail corporate news, new products and features, dealer stories, events, etc.

During my time there, we put this magazine online as well. However, not everyone was aware of it or checked it that often. Its been some years since I've worked there, but this online magazine gave me the idea of a quarterly email to be sent in tandem with the distribution of the printed brochure, with links to the appropriate articles, which is exactly what I made.
